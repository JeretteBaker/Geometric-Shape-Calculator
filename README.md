# Project Description:
My project is a console based application that can allow users to calculate the area and
perimeter or circumference of circles, rectangles, and triangles. The Shape class is an
abstract class that serves as a base class for the specific shapes (Circle, Rectangle,
and Triangle). The calculate_area and calculate_perimeter methods are defined as
abstract methods in the Shape class, and they are implemented in the specific shape
classes.
The main function allows the user to enter the type of shape (circle, rectangle, or
triangle) and its dimensions. The program then calculates the area and perimeter of the
shape and prints the results. The user can quit the program by entering "quit" as the
shape.

# Importance and contribution of the project:
This geometric shape calculator program can be a valuable tool for students, teachers,
and anyone who needs to perform basic calculations of areas and perimeters of
shapes. It provides a user-friendly interface that can simplify these calculations and
potentially improve the knowledge of students.
Engineers and designers can also this program to quickly calculate the area and
perimeter of shapes in their designs, aiding in tasks such as architectural planning. It
can be used as a handy tool for solving geometry related problems in various subjects,
including mathematics, physics.
